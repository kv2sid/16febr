    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer - A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows easy access, retrieval, and management of information. It is a central repository that stores data and helps manage and organize it efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases use a relational data model, where data is stored in tables with predefined columns and relationships between them. SQL is a standard language used to query and manage relational databases. It is used for inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data in a structured format. SQL databases are known for their strong consistency and ACID properties, making them suitable for applications that require strict data integrity and consistency, such as financial systems or e-commerce applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases use a non-relational data model and do not rely on predefined schemas or relationships. They store data in a more flexible and dynamic format, such as documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. NoSQL databases are designed for high scalability, availability, and performance, making them suitable for applications that require handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media, gaming, or IoT applications. NoSQL databases typically use their own query languages, such as MongoDB's BSON or Cassandra's CQL, which are designed for specific data models and use cases."

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer - DDL statements are used to define and manage the structure of a database, including creating, modifying, and deleting database objects. The CREATE statement is used to create new objects, the DROP statement is used to remove objects, the ALTER statement is used to modify objects, and the TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table while keeping its structure intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create = The CREATE statement is used to create a new database object, such as a table, index, or view.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP: The DROP statement is used to remove an existing database object.\n",

    "CRUD operations to create, read, update and delete data.\n",
    "Using INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands.\n",
    "DML commands are often part of a more extensive database language, for example, SQL (structured query language). These DMLs can have a specific syntax to handle data in that language.\n",
    "DML has two main classifications which are procedural and non-procedural programming, which is also called declarative programming. The SQL dealing with the manipulation of data present in the database belongs to the DML or Data Manipulation Language, including most of the SQL statements.\n",

    "\n",
    "In essence, DQL provides powerful querying capabilities over your object model. Imagine all your objects lying around in some storage (like an object database). When writing DQL queries, think about querying that storage to pick a certain subset of your objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "The primary key column has a unique value and doesn’t store repeating values. A Primary key can never take NULL values.\n",

    "A foreign key is a field or collection of fields in a table that refers to the Primary key of the other table. It is responsible for managing the relationship between the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table which contains the foreign key is often called the child table, and the table whose primary key is being referred by the foreign key is called the Parent Table."
